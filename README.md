I recently learned that many people in Russia have no idea what's happening in Ukraine right now.

If your site reaches an audience in Russia, you can help change that by including this snippet that adds information about the invasion.

## Getting Started

Just add this script tag to your website:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/abejfehr/ukraine-info-banner@latest/dist/snippet.js"></script>
```

Your site will now have a banner targeted only to users within Russia.

## Demo site

See what it looks like for yourself [here](https://www.abefehr.com/ukraine-info-banner/?ua-info-banner=true).

In English, the text in the overlay reads:

> **Russia invades Ukraine**
>
> War is being waged against your Ukrainian brothers and has claimed many victims.
>
> Your government is hiding the truth from you.
>
> Please spread the word.

## Testing

If you'd like to see the banner for yourself, just add a query param to your site to preview it:

```bash
http://www.yoursitedomain.com?ua-info-banner=true
```
