# Ukraine Info Snippet

> An embeddable snippet with information about the situation in Ukraine designed for a Russian Audience

I recently learned that many people in Russia have no idea what's happening in Ukraine right now.

If your site reaches an audience in Russia, you can help change that by including this snippet that adds information about the invasion.

## Getting Started

Just add this script tag to your website

```html
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abejfehr/ukraine-snippet/main/dist/snippet.js"></script>
```

Your site will now have a banner targeted only to users within Russia.

## Preview

The site injects a banner that looks like this:

If you'd like to see the banner for yourself, just add a query param to your site to preview it:

```bash
http://www.yoursitedomain.com?ua-info-snippet=true
```
