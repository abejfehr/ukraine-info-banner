    <h1>Ukraine Info Snippet</h1>
    <p>
      An embeddable snippet with information about the situation in Ukraine
      designed for a Russian Audience
    </p>
    <p>
      I recently learned that many people in Russia have no idea what's
      happening in Ukraine right now.

    <p>
      If your site reaches an audience in Russia, you can help change that by
      including this snippet that adds information about the invasion.
